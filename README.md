# Week Nine Day Two: Inheritance

In this assignment, you'll be implementing various classes. 

For a warm-up today, you will first add code to [Person.java](src/main/java/Person.java) to implement the Person class. Then, you will add some code to [PersonClient.java](src/main/java/PersonClient.java) that carries of some very very basic testing code.

## Run your code with:
The easiest way to run your code is to press the play button in [PersonClient.java](src/main/java/PersonClient.java).

However, you can also run your code by typing the following into the Terminal.

```shell script
make run
```

Alternatively, if that doesn't work, use:

```shell script
./gradlew run
```
